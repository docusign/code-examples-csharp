# C# Launcher Code Examples

### GitHub repo: [code-examples-csharp](./README.md)

This GitHub repo includes code examples for the DocuSign Admin API, Click API, eSignature REST API, Monitor API, and Rooms API. To switch between API code examples, modify the `ExamplesAPI` setting from `ESignature` to `Admin`, `Click`, `Monitor`, or  `Rooms`, in the appsettings.json file. 


## Introduction
This repo is a C# .NET Core MVC application that demonstrates:  

* Authentication with DocuSign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.  

* Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.  


## eSignature API

For more information about the scopes used for obtaining authorization to use the eSignature API, see [Required scopes](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/esign101/auth#required-scopes).  

For a list of code examples that use the eSignature API, see the [How-to guides overview](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/how-to/) on the DocuSign Developer Center.


## Rooms API 

**Note:** To use the Rooms API, you must also [create your Rooms developer account](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/rooms-api/rooms101/create-account). Examples 4 and 6 require that you have the DocuSign Forms feature enabled in your Rooms for Real Estate account.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.  

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.  
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/) authentication.  

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.  
   
   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.  

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the User ID GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.  

   For both authentication flows:  
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of https://localhost:44333/ds/callback  

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as   
   
   {base_url}/ds/callback  
   
   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.  
   
1. [C# .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) 3.1 or later.  
1. [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with ASP.NET package
